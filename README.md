# uncertainCBSAandRUCA
Replication script for paper "The role of uncertainty in delineations of Core Based Statistical Areas and Rural Urban Commuting Areas" including code for delineating CBSA and RUCA codes

By default the main .qmd file will run all the code in DataPrep.R which downloads almost all of the data needed to produce the paper. You may need to walk through the DataPrep script manually though to download a few files from public sources that could not be accessed automatically via R.
